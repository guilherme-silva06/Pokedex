#Pokedex

This is a project that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a small pokedex (a pokemon wiki), aiming for responsiveness, a beautiful look and a clean code.

This project was created with the knowledge obtained from "mapadev-week", a Brazilian online programming event where different parts of a web application are covered.

The final page looks like this:
